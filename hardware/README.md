# Chassis Controller Hardware

## RS232 Serial Connection
Useful for getting debug output from the microcontroller. Uses a USB-to-RS232 adaptor and a custom DB9 to DTM-3P cable.

### Pinout

DB9 Connector

| Pin Number | Designation |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | |
| 2 | RX |
| 3 | TX |
| 4 | |
| 5 | Ground |
| 6 | |
| 7 | |
| 8 | |
| 9 | |

DTM-3P Connector

| Pin Number | Designation |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Ground |
| 2 | TX |
| 3 | RX |

Remember that for serial to work RX and TX must be swapped or "crossed over" during the wiring.
